# CS-255 DriverPass Project

*The team at DriverPass wanted to fill available space in driver's education. The concept behind the DriverPass web app was to implement a cloud-based website that offers its users driving lessons both in person and online, as well as practice tests with traceable results.  

*In this project, I feel that I aligned well with the stakeholders' requests to simply drive home exactly what they were asking for. I interpreted the project requirements and brought them to life with the use of multiple UML diagrams and technological requirements. 

*Given more time I would dig deeper into the functionality and the relationships between each component of the system. This extra detail would include additional descriptions of the implementation given in the UML diagrams. More time would be needed to professionally lay out the system requirements so that they are ready for the development team in a real-world scenario.  

*To interpret the needs of the user I considered the stakeholders' requirements and how they would be brought to life in the UI. Users need to be able to easily navigate the system and make full use of each of its components. This is important for any application but of particular value in SASS systems and ones involving education. If the user struggles with the UI they are less likely to continue paying for a plan, and ultimately are more likely to fail in testing.  

*When designing a system, I would consider all its actors and the goal of the system. I find it is easier to start at the top with where the actor first exists, then mark down the end goal. After this, dig into what is required and the steps to get there, this is going to fill in the middle. If we correctly go from the user to the end result, we should have mapped out most of the product requirements and should feel confident moving forward.
